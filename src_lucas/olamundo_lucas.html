        <p>Ghosts are small, sapient machines created by the Traveler shortly after the Collapse. Their sole
            purpose is to locate and resurrect deceased individuals capable of wielding the Light as Guardians, and to
            support
            their Guardian charge in combat.

        <p id="overview-p">After the Collapse, the wounded Traveler deliberately shed many pieces of itself. These pieces
            understood intuitively that they had a mission to raise a companion from the dead, their Chosen, and created
            mechanical shells for themselves. Every Ghost that exists was created in that moment; they are otherwise
            irreplaceable. Despite their origin as pieces of the Traveler, Ghosts do not possess any special insight
            into
            the nature of the Traveler, or into other matters pertaining to the Light and Darkness.
